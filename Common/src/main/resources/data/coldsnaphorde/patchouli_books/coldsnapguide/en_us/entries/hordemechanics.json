Hordes will continuously spawn in enemies around a determined \"Anchor\" player until a spawn cap is met. When the player kills a horde member, the horde member will be replaced until enough enemies are killed to end the event."

If the spawning algorithm fails to find a valid spawn point randomly after several attempts, the horde will be ended as a draw, and the mod will not progress. If all players within visible range of the horde health bar are killed, the horde ends as a player loss. If the \"Anchor\" player is killed, and other players remain within range, anchor status carries to an in range player."
